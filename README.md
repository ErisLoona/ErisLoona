Heyo, I'm Eris and I love creating my own tools for the most obscure of tasks, even if they may sometimes be readily available.<br />
- My preferred language is easily C#, I find it easier to work with than most others and I especially like that there is ample documentation on it that is easily readable. I have *some* experience with JavaScript from Google AppsScript which I used to make some custom tools for myself in Sheets, and also know C++ but one would have to torture me to get me to use it.
- I learn on the fly most of the time, and in my humble opinion I'm good at that, but I do have my off days when I forget the most basic of things. I had to Google how to do a bubble sort more than once. I have a bachelor's degree in programming but I learnt a lot by myself. Always trying new nonsense.
- If you wanna talk to me, contact me on Discord, [@erisloona](https://discordapp.com/users/158518077426761729).
